I am trying to use this project to demonstrate how to push samples via LSL in the Android. 

There are two classes in this project: MainActicity and SendingThread. The MainActivity is used to 
display the GUI so you can start a LSL stream by pressing "Push random numbers" button, or to close a LSL stream
by pressing "Stop LSL stream". "Exit" button, of course, is to close this application. 
The SendingThread is an independent thread generates random numbers and push them into LSL stream 
created by MainActicity.

Please let me know if you run into any bugs, thank you.
